# User Configuration

## Settings

You can edit your admin account (username and password) in the settings page (link is in footer).

You can also set options to display release date and/or genre of your own list. Both will still display on search, trending and upcoming. If you want to hide your ratings (or show only on hover) there is also an option for this.

There is an option to enable or disable spoiler protection for episode names.
